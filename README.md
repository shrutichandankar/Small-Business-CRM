# HOW THE PROJECT WORKS

- User authentication is implemented using PHP Sessions.
- `auth_check.php` prevents unauthorized access to protected pages.
- Database connectivity is handled using `config.php`.
- Customer, Lead, Sales, Support, and Communication modules use MySQL for data storage.
- CRUD operations are implemented for Customers and Leads.
- Passwords are securely stored using `password_hash()` and verified using `password_verify()`.
- User input is sanitized using `mysqli_real_escape_string()` and displayed safely using `htmlspecialchars()` to reduce security risks.
- Customers and Leads are connected through a foreign key (`customer_id`) with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
